# hello-world

This is my first repository and my first time using Github.

Hello, my name is Nick Regan.  I am a student at Cincinnati State, where I study Computer Programming and Database Management.
My favorite meal of the day is brunch, ideally that would involve a heaping pile of biscuits and gravy.
I also have a beautiful, baby pup named Arya, whom I love very, very much.
